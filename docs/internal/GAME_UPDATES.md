# Deadlock updates and Dolly

## Shared reviewed contracts (unreleased hardening)

`native/profiles/manifest.json` controls accepted module fingerprints and the
narrower feature pins. `native/profiles/runtime-contracts.json` now holds the
shared current preload, replay-camera, Follow and attachment definitions. Its
module identities reference existing reviewed profiles where available. Named
schema fields retain their evidence, stock getter bytes and audited code spans;
attachment field names/types and wire order are shared by Python and native code.
Older Follow correction profiles keep their own layouts and exact checked bytes.

Use the unified generator from the repository root:

```powershell
python tools/generate_compatibility.py --check
python tools/generate_compatibility.py --write
python tools/generate_compatibility.py --check --verify-game-dir "<Deadlock install>"
```

`--check` is the default and detects stale generated files without writing.
`--write` validates saved reviews and regenerates the Python runtime constants,
native runtime definitions, Follow correction table, camera header and sound
header. It needs no installed game and never changes accepted fingerprints or
approves a new build. Native builds run the check before removing the previous
DLL. Edit the reviewed inputs and generator, not generated files.

The optional `--verify-game-dir` reads installed PE files; it never launches or
attaches to Deadlock. It checks the current runtime contract's exact client,
tier0 and resource identities, saved code spans, and named observer-services
field against both stock getters. It needs the build dependencies used by the
profile tools. This is offline evidence, not an in-game or output certification.

For a game update, first review the changed subsystems and retain the old
profiles. The existing client and sound profile tools remain discovery tools;
their output still needs review. Update the relevant saved contracts, evidence
and manifest pins, then regenerate all five outputs with the unified command.
Inspect the diff, run the Python/native checks, and verify the actual affected
workflow in a bounded owned replay before claiming new runtime support.
Never widen preload or an optional feature's support merely because camera
code was accepted.

This migration preserves existing values, behavior and feature gates. It does
not automatically discover every private layout or make Dolly update-proof.
Historical attachment branches and separate renderer/Depth/Players contracts
remain independently reviewed; this work does not expand their support.

## Version6722 hotfix and Follow slide correction

Steam build25614556 uses client44a50bc2.../image40f5000. Exact original6712
and6722 PE files were compared privately; startup, replay, observer, camera,
entity resolver and effect wrapper RVAs/types are reviewed and updated. Other
six reviewed game modules and original gameinfo are unchanged. The separate
hotfix camera profile preserves older profiles and exact-build admission.

The stock normal crouch camera composition still initializes one intermediate
world anchor to zero; custom overrides leave it zero. Blending scales the hero's
world anchor toward map origin. Dolly's guarded correction scopes the actual
current ThirdPerson camera and full observer/tracked-pawn identity, then passes
a private input descriptor with the valid anchor into the exact faulty blend.
Angles, offsets, crouch weight, later ADS/sequence effects and collision remain
stock. No persistent game memory or installed game files are patched. Exact
module and live function bytes gate the resident detours. Missing ownership,
changed config/command, nonfinite data or another callsite passes through.
Optional diagnostics report scopes/blends/corrections/rejections for live proof.
This correction still needs bounded runtime and visual acceptance.

## Build 6712 replay startup and schema printing

Production startup now waits for the reviewed normal replay camera handoff
before pausing. The selected replay and first-packet gates remain intact;
read-only, exact-build camera checks replace no existing safety checks.
The state-based starting view and responsive controls were visually accepted.

The stock detailed pawn-schema printer crashes while recursively expanding an
inline structure in this build (schemasystem+0xa4e3, null record). Attachment
queries now use `schema_dump_binding C_CitadelPlayerPawn`, whose reviewed
nonrecursive mode retains typed top-level rows. Existing presence, type and
offset validation remains; the other three schema queries are unchanged.
Bounded live verification returned m_angEyeAngles at4352 as QAngle and exited
normally. Roster/bone and export compatibility checks remain incomplete.

The entity-system global also moved outside the legacy attach-roster scan
window. The new exact-client path verifies initializer20049f0 and resolves
global3cfc7c0, requiring the reviewed CGameEntitySystem primary RTTI vtable on
each lookup. Existing player list, identity and handle validation is retained.
Unrecognized legacy clients retain their existing resolver; a recognized new
client with invalid initializer/type data refuses resolution.

Source-audio event capture worked, but the start-parameter structure shifted:
the initial amplitude/envelope float moved0x24->0x20 and the legacy rate/fade
parameter float moved0x30->0x2c. These offsets now belong to the selected sound
profile, including signature fallback; missing metadata refuses resolution.
The field at new0x30 is integer pitch and must not be read as the old float.
CSV columns retain their meanings; source_volume is not final mixed loudness,
and source_rate_parameter is not asserted to be pitch. Runtime retest pending.

## Build 6712 offline compatibility review (2026-09-29)

The September 29 profiles cover the camera wrapper and changed view fields,
engine replay accessors, ICvar interface, ten-argument scene producer, renderer
buffer/retirement layouts, audio voice map, particle wrappers, screen effects,
and preload completion. Exact module gates remain in place. The scene producer
requires its matching reviewed renderer because the GPU buffer member moved
from +0x60 to +0x70. CPU allocation pointers remain +0x18. Older camera, engine,
scene, renderer and audio profiles are retained; automatic preload and the editing
baseline target the new build.

The camera's new wrapper is exact-build only; it must not seed the old camera
signature fallback. Its profile generator verifies the reviewed camera functions,
RTTI and engine/tier0 identities before emission. The new unlocker includes a
DLL-local ICvar adapter for two removed virtual slots and tolerates the removed
optional string-token debug export. Its patch and provenance are bundled under
`third_party/cvar_unlocker/`; secure-mode and shutdown guards remain enforced.

The audio generator now emits current `soundsystem-2026-09-29.json` and retained
`soundsystem-2026-09-09.json` profiles. Resolution carries each profile's voice-map
offset and rejects ambiguous cross-profile matches. No game binary is needed to
regenerate the header from saved profiles.

These are offline-reviewed compatibility changes, not an in-game certification.
An owned replay startup, camera/F9 recovery, audio and layered export still need
runtime verification before release. No running game was inspected or modified.

## Complete module scan and audio fallback (2026-09-28)

**Check game build** and Native launch now hash seven game modules in one scan:
`client`, `engine2`, `tier0`, `scenesystem`, `soundsystem`, `resourcesystem`, and
`rendersystemdx11`. The manifest lists the existing reviewed pins for all seven.
The details include observed hash, review date, newer-than-reviewed status and
the affected feature. Unknown or missing optional modules make the overall
report unsupported/incomplete but do not change the three-module camera launch
gate. Players capture, audio, preload and renderer diagnostics keep their own
runtime gates. The unlocker's `server.dll` is Dolly's bundled binary, checked
separately, not an installed game-module dependency.

Audio now has an exact-hash fast path and a fail-closed signature fallback.
`tools/generate_sound_profile.py` creates five unique masked instruction-prefix
signatures from the exact reviewed sound binary: four hooks plus the event-name
helper. RIP displacements and direct call/jump operands are wildcarded using
Capstone's operand offsets/sizes. Four decoded RIP-relative references, from
three independent functions, must agree on one aligned slot in writable,
non-executable `.data`. All five prologues are checked. Ambiguous/missing matches,
changed fixed bytes or disagreeing/out-of-range pointers leave audio disabled.
The native worker probes each loaded module base once, avoiding repeated scans
of an unsupported build. The offline Python scan still reports an unknown sound
hash as unreviewed; it does not claim that the native fallback has succeeded.

The saved `native/profiles/soundsystem-2026-09-09.json` preserves the signatures
after Steam replaces the binary. Regenerate its header with
`python tools/generate_sound_profile.py`; add `--game-dir <Deadlock>` only to
rebuild the profile from its exact reviewed binary. The normal client generator
also emits the sound header from this saved profile. It preserves optional
module pins instead of approving them during a client-only review. New sound
code/layouts require a fresh review and updated profile; prefix matches do not
prove every helper or data layout unchanged.

The generated client header and `dolly/preload.py::CLIENT_SHA256` now obtain
their hashes from saved reviewed inputs through the unified generator above.
Camera support accepts several older hashes; preload's code/layout review
accepts one. The manifest's `feature_pins` records that narrower requirement,
which the generator checks against the runtime contract. An older accepted
camera build therefore does not imply preload support. Existing tests also
cross-check the resource-system, native scene, sound and renderer pins. Review
each relevant subsystem before updating its inputs; do not copy the camera's
accepted hash list into preload.

Validation is offline: generated signatures are unique in the installed PE,
native resolution is checked against its full `.text` snapshot, and synthetic
tests cover moved functions/data, signed displacements, ambiguity, changed
prologues, truncation and invalid table targets. A bounded owned replay remains
necessary before claiming in-game capture behavior on a newly updated build.

## Compatibility scanner and generator — 0.5.3

`native/profiles/manifest.json` is the single source of truth for the reviewed
builds. It lists the accepted SHA-256 pin for every reviewed `client.dll`,
`engine2.dll` and `tier0.dll`, plus the date each module was last reviewed.
The Python launcher, the native bridge and `tests/test_native_packaging.py` all
read the same pins, so they cannot drift apart.

On every Native launch Dolly re-hashes the installed modules and classifies the
build:

| Result | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Supported | Every installed module hash is listed for this Dolly release. |
| Unsupported | A module is not listed. The message names each module, the observed hash, the reviewed date and whether the file is newer than the review. |
| Incomplete | A required module is missing from the install. |

No network request is made; the manifest is bundled. **Home → Troubleshooting →
Check game build** runs the same scan on demand.

### The AOB fallback

A new game build is normally blocked until its profile is reviewed. When a build
is not listed, the native bridge may still recognize it if a reviewed profile's
wildcard signature matches exactly one location in `.text`. A signature is the
reviewed function body with every RIP-relative displacement and call/jump
operand wildcarded, so it matches only code that is byte-identical modulo
relocated addresses. On a match the bridge re-derives every other camera symbol
from the image (the direct caller, the `CViewRender` vtable through its RTTI
locator, the `SetGlobals` globals pointer and the aspect-source interface
pointer). If any symbol is ambiguous or missing, or the reviewed 32-byte
prologue changed, the build stays blocked. Layout changes still require a new
reviewed profile.

### Generating a profile after a game update

1. Run `python tools/generate_profile.py --game-dir <Deadlock> --previous
   <last-complete-profile> --label <YYYY-MM-DD> --update-manifest`.
   It requires `pefile` and `capstone` (see `requirements-build.txt`).
2. Inspect the generated profile and header diff. Confirm the main view setup,
   caller, vtable, globals and engine-client addresses and that field offsets are
   unchanged.
3. Rebuild `DollyNative.dll` on Windows x64 (see
   [BUILDING.md](../BUILDING.md)) and ship a release that lists the new build.
4. Play a short path in the updated client and Stop / restore before publishing.

## 0.3.13 compatibility

This release supports the supplied September 9 client.dll, engine2.dll and tier0.dll.
The previous September 7 client remains supported. Both use the same native
camera hook, view layout, clock access and DOF bridge. Camera movement and
interpolation code were not changed.

The native loader verifies complete file fingerprints. A familiar function
prologue alone is not enough to approve a changed game. In this update, both
camera functions were reconstructed from the saved previous disassembly and
compared against the new file; the only changes were six calls to relocated
helpers. The relocated framing helper was separately checked for equivalence.
The bundled new compatibility profile records this static review.

The new engine2 has identical executable code, data, relocation and exception
sections. The mapped-section differences are debug timestamps and PDB age.
The saved tier0 setter/callback disassembly matches (3,530 instructions), and
its current lookup/data-accessor ABI and interface slots were reviewed.
All three game modules retain exact fingerprint checks. The game's server.dll
is not a native-camera compatibility dependency and is not bundled.

## Install this complete update

1. Extract Deadlock_Dolly_0.3.13_Source.zip. This is the complete repository
   source, including native/src/dolly_effects.cpp and native/tests/effect_tests.cpp.
2. Upload its contents at the GitHub repository root, preserving folder paths.
   For browser uploads use batches: native first, dolly and tests next, then
   remaining folders/root files. Commit every batch before building.
3. Start a new Build Windows app run on the updated branch. Re-running an old
   failed run uses its old checkout and will not include the new commits.
4. Download the successful artifact and extract its Windows_x64 ZIP into a
   fresh directory. Keep Dolly.exe and the complete _internal folder together.
5. Check native startup, play a short path twice, animate DOF, and Stop / restore.

## Future updates

This version does not automatically download or install Dolly updates.
The release page is https://github.com/cravvnn/deadlock-dolly/releases.

An update checker can notify users when a matching reviewed Dolly release
is available. Automatic delivery is separate from compatibility validation:
an updater cannot prove that changed game code still uses the same fields,
interfaces, calling conventions or rendering order.

A future implementation can detect installed module fingerprints, compare
them to compatibility metadata attached to a published release, and offer
that complete Windows package. Unrecognized builds should remain blocked in
Native mode until reviewed. Pattern scanning can help maintainers locate
relocated functions, but must not automatically approve an unknown layout.

Console mode remains a temporary alternative when Native is unavailable.
It uses console delivery and does not provide native per-render-frame camera
and DOF synchronization. The bundled unlocker must still work with that build.
